# 1. Copy this file to a new file named .env
#    cp env.example .env
# 2. Edit the .env file to match your local setup if it differs from this example.

# NOTE: The .env file is ignored by git, so your personal paths will not be
#       committed to the repository. This Makefile will automatically load it.
